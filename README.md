# WEEK-1

Week 1 Project Submission

Project Overview:
This repository contains the work completed for Week 1 of the "TO DEVELOP A CNN MODEL TO CLASSIFY IMAGES OF PLASTIC". In this week's assignment, I focused on "creating a data visualization using Python".

Key Deliverables:
- Data Analysis: Performed initial data exploration and cleaning of the dataset. Identified key patterns and insights that will inform future analyses.
- Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate data distributions, trends, and relationships. For example, a pie chart was used to show the distribution of pie chart. 
- Code Structure:
    - Used Python/Matplotlib/Pandas to process and visualize the data.
    - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas, addressing missing values and standardizing columns.
  
Features:
- Pie Chart: Displays the proportions of  "organic" vs. "recyclable" items in a dataset, with customization such as slice explosions and dynamic labeling.
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data and ensured that all entries were valid and ready for analysis.
  
Technologies Used:
- Python: For coding the data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
  
Learning Outcomes:
- Developed a deeper understanding of  "data visualization", "data preprocessing", and "exploratory data analysis".
- Gained hands-on experience with Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to manipulate and visualize data.
  
Next Steps:
For upcoming weeks, I will focus on:
- Further refining the analysis and experimenting with more complex visualizations.
- Implementing additional statistical methods to interpret the dataset.
- Exploring other aspects of the dataset to gain more insights.
